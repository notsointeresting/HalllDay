## 🚨 Current Priorities (Immediate Focus)

### ⚙️ Phase 6: Admin & Dev Tools (Material 3 Port)
*Goal: Unified Material 3 Design for all surfaces.*
- [ ] **Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)**:
    - [ ] **Roster Management**:
        - [x] Manual Ban List (View all students, toggle ban status).
        - [x] Roster Clear: Ensure session history is cleared (or properly handled) to remove "Anonymous" ghost stats.
    - [x] Port "Pass Logs".
    - [ ] Material 3 Data Tables and Charts.
    - [ ] A CSV template or instructions for uploading a roster properly (header row, id, name). 
- [ ] **Dev Dashboard (`/dev`)**:
    - [ ] Port "Database Tools" and "System Status".
    - [ ] Secure with PIN/Auth.
    - [ ] More robust ability to manage users, see active sessions/passes etc in /dev

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

### 🖥️ Phase 7: Passive Display (Enhancements)
- [ ] **Sync**: Ensure Display state perfectly mirrors Kiosk state (latency < 1s).
- [x] Build landing page with logo, sign up screen/login, and FAQ (explanation/introduction) or something. idkcanyou.com should default to the landing page (homepage) and have tabs or some way to navigate to the admin, kiosk and display pages. I think this may have already been started by an agent but it was not completed or not properly implemented. 
### 🖥️ Phase 8 [Optional Queue System]
- [] Allow students to queue up for a pass optionally enabled by teacher on their admin panel. Will automatically assign a pass to the first person in the queue and then assign the next person in the queue to the next available pass.
- [] Build a scheduling system for times when kiosk is active and auto suspend when not; connected to admin panel as option and timezone selection. T

### 📡 Phase 9: Server-Sent Events (SSE) Optimization
*Goal: Replace polling with push-based updates for efficiency.*
- [ ] **Backend**: Add `/api/stream` endpoint using Flask SSE (generator with `yield`).
- [ ] **Frontend**: Replace `Timer.periodic` polling with `EventSource` listener in Kiosk/Display.
- [ ] **Benefits**: ~99% fewer requests, instant updates (<100ms latency), reduced server load.
